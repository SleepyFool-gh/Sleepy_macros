# SleepyFool's macros & other things

A motley library of author tools with dubious value

### SugarCube macros

  - [divider macro](./divider_macro) - creates a divider while hiding old dividers created this way
  - [p macro](./p_macro) - automatically wrap enclosed chunks of text into `<p>` elements
  - [select macro](./select_macro) - creates a link which removes all other links in its group when clicked

### SugarCube accs.

  - [save safety](./save_safety/) - adds two checkboxes to prevent accidental deleting or clearing of saves

### Twine accs.

  - [Twine desktop app themes](./Twine_themes) - `user.css` customization options for <b>Twine desktop 2.7</b>

### Misc

  - [CSS pack](./css_pack) - a `CSS` pack created to imitate Harlowe's quick `(text-style:)`, should work for any `HTML`
